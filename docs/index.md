## What is audio?

In these page i will dedicate it to explain several contents that i consider important about audio, give some tips and try to help on the basics of audio, followed by a template example.

### Dialogue

Dialogue takes mainly all the speeches made by any characters or entities in the game; this type of audio tends to have several types of preparation behind it, from scripting to editing.

- Scripting

The audio requires a certain type of preparation, which is used in films, series, theater and some others, video games are no exception, normally before recording any audio you must script what the character will say, that will be bond to the lore and characteristics of the characters, and must representante the character, if he stutterer, if he is a feelingles entity, maybe he have a strange accent, all this things must be prepared and written down before the recording.

- Recording

During a recording we can choose how we want the audio to sound, or else if we want to add it during the editing, the effects that you may add during the recording can range from rain to a cave echo, these can be hard to make, but they may make the dialogue sound more realistic compared to adding a echo filter to the audio.

- Editing

In these part we add any needed effect on the audio to make it sound the way we want, maybe we want a robotic enemy, therefore we will have to add a robotic filter to the voice recorded to make it sound like it, or maybe we want a impossibly demonic voice and we must lower the pitch to one unhumand level. Also in this phase we must make sure the editing is as unnoticeable as possible, avoiding making a loop too obvious or clearing unwanted background noises as static or fan noises.

### Encourage emotions

Audio can influence the way that a player engages any obstacle, or how they perceive a scene, these can be used in order to control to a certain degree the player’s decision making.

- Music

A clear example of music would be Doom, in which the music boosts the player’s feeling of power and or confidence making it feel unstoppable therefore the player will engage more ferociously against its opponents. Another example of this would be a sad scene, in which the players tend to feel sad by the loss of one important character, these feelings can be increased with a proper soundtrack that goes along the scene.

- Sounds

Sounds can be helpful on horror scenes, where we want to scare our players, a properly settled sound effect around him or in the distance can increase the tension in the scene. As another example of these can be found in any war game when we want to make the player feel the power of any weaponry by adding a strong sound effect to it.

- Storytelling

A properly implemented story and dialogue, we can make the player who likes the story feel what the characters are going through. These can be achieved with a properly written story with interesting characters and a good sound development.

### Immersion

Immersion in video games is really important in case we want a serious approach, therefore a proper implementation of audio and music is critical.

One example of these is Pavlov(vr), in these game the sound feels real, making the player believe that he is actually shooting a real weapon, these feeling of reality or immersion can be improved through environmental sounds, which can include wind, animals and climate between others, these is really important in games where we want to give a realistic feeling of freedom and exploration.

### Indicate locations

Audio can help to notice locations, these can range from several things, all of them tend to be mainly a tool for the player to help him know where he is or where something is located.

A simple example of these is to know where you are being attacked from, these is indirectly used in many games, but a properly implemented sound range can help to locate where you are being attacked from, to the distance of the aggressor; Another examples which is related to these one would be haunting or horror games, in which the noises take great importance to track down the target or the aggressor, in these sort of games the audio can be critical to help the player on it’s awareness of its surroundings.

### Audio types

There are 4 main sound types, these are used to order audio in these categories for better team coordination.

- Sound Effects (SFX)

Sound effects envolve all generic souns, these sounds can go from gunshots to walking, tend to gane importance on games that relay more on storytelling.

- Foley

Foley is the most common technique used in this type of recording, so it’s worth to know about its existence.

- Music (MX)

These gropes all the music data, from simple single instrument sounds to full singed songs.

- Dialogue (DX)

Dialogue is any speech that needs to be added to the game.

- Backgrounds (BG)

Background overtakes any sound effect that plays in the rear of the main action.

### Audio Bible

The audio bible refers to one important document, the Audio design document, which contains all the important data about audio. 

This document is used for large development groups, it contains things such as the audio pillars, music styles, sound effects between some others which I'll discuss later, these can be used to coordinate all the team and help new additions adapt quicker and with ease.

- Synopsis

A description of the game must be provided, which explains the main concepts of the game in order to let us know what type of project we are pursuing alongside with a link or documentation of de GDD.

- Audio pillars

These pillars resemble the ones used for the game, but focused on the audio aspect of it.

- Sound effects

In these parts we must define the sound palette where we will find all sounds needed,Ambience sounds are all the background noises and Dynamic range which basically means the distance in which a sound can be heard.

- Music

On the music side we must describe its style, the instrumentation that is going to be needed, the methodology of recording and once again the range.

- Dialog

The dialog category will consist of a list containing all the characters that will need to be recorded, voice types, an orientation of the characters attitude, special effects for the voices, the cast size needed and the scripts.

- Technology

In here we will need to list the budget, space limit, file formats, platforms that are going to be used, all the instruments needed for recording and implementing the audio in the game.

- Naming Conventions

All the rules about the files and audio naming.
